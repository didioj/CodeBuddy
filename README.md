# CodeBuddy

CodeBuddy is an algorithm library for the Atom editor. The package includes templates for widely used algorithms in computer science along with common operations in a variety of languages, along with features allowing the user to quickly and easily incorporate these into their project.

### Algorithms to implement:  
- sorting arrays
- graph algorithms
- file i/o
- search algorithm
- etc..

We plan to cover as many algorithms as we can from [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-algorithms-and-data-structures-for-competitive-programming/) webpage
